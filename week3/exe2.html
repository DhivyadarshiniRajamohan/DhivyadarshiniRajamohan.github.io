    <h2>"Infinite possibilities contained in a finite space."</h2>

    <p>My name's Dhivya, an art student with a huge interest in games. My taste is varied, from cute, cozy games like
        Stardew Valley, to nitty gritty ones like Devil May Cry, I love them both and everything in between.</p>
    <p>Recently, I've gotten into playing Magic the Gathering, and have been obsessed. It's a fun social game which
        helps me step out of my comfort zone and actually get out of the house to make new friends and bond together
        over the game. In fact, the quote displayed comes from that very game!</p>
